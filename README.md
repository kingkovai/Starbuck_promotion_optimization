# Starbuck promotion strategy optimization
### Objective
  Starbuck provides offers to its mobile app registered customers in order to attract and retains its customer to improves its sales. Objective is to find out customers who are more likely to respond to their promotion based on the demographic details of the customer.To optimize the promotion strategy I put forward below 2 questions.\
   Q1. Which are the demographic categories that have responded well to offers, so that promotions can be designed considering the demographic features?\
   Q2. Which customers are more likely to respond to the offers ? so that promotion can be done specific to those customers instead of launching for all customers.
